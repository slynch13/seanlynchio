Well, I got my first major feature for [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/) done, blog/domain aliases for the blog, but I find myself hesitant to click commit. Its not that I doubt it works, it is currently running on my blog right now. I just don&#8217;t feel comfortable checking in code that I can&#8217;t respond to problems with for about 19 hours, and would hate to really foobar stuff so soon after getting commit access ;).

After I do check it in, something along the lines this will be showing in the host admin:

This works a lot like the www prefix currently does.

So I've decided to wait till tomorrow after work to commit. Will likely type of some what I learned type of post too, mostly to get in the habit.
